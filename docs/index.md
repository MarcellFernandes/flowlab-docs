# FlowLab — Laboratory Workflow Documentation

Welcome to the **FlowLab Laboratory Use Case Documentation**, a technical writing portfolio project that models the lifecycle of laboratory exam processing — from patient registration to secure report delivery.

This documentation demonstrates how complex operational workflows can be translated into clear, structured technical communication.

---

## Project Purpose

This project simulates a real-world laboratory information system and focuses on:

- translating operational workflows into readable documentation
- structuring complex processes for clarity
- defining actors, lifecycle states, and responsibilities
- demonstrating technical writing best practices

All systems, data, and identifiers are fictional and exist solely for documentation purposes.

---

## System Overview

FlowLab represents a laboratory ecosystem where:

- patient samples are registered and tracked
- diagnostic devices generate exam results
- interface software translates device output
- technical staff validate sector-specific exams
- lab management performs final approval
- reports are securely generated and delivered
- optional integration with external hospital systems occurs

The workflow models real operational constraints while remaining implementation-agnostic.

## Documentation Structure

This site is organized into three main sections:

### Overview

Provides conceptual context, actors, lifecycle states, and workflow logic.

→ Ideal for understanding system behavior and responsibilities.

---

### Quickstart

Step-by-step operational checklist to deploy and validate the workflow.

→ Focused on practical execution and verification.

---

### Diagrams

Visual representations of architecture and workflow flows.

→ Helps bridge conceptual understanding with system structure.

---

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Technical workflow modeling
- Structured documentation writing
- Lifecycle/state representation
- Actor responsibility mapping
- Operational clarity
- Documentation readability and hierarchy

---

## Intended Audience

This documentation is written for:

- technical writers
- system integrators
- lab operations stakeholders
- software engineers
- reviewers evaluating documentation skills

---

## Author Note

This project exists to demonstrate professional technical writing practices applied to a realistic workflow scenario.

The focus is clarity, structure, and operational understanding — not implementation detail.

---

## Next Steps

Start with the **Overview** to understand the workflow model, then explore the **Quickstart** and **Diagrams** to see how the system operates end-to-end.
